# News Site

This is my first project in the Technigo Web Development Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a multi platform friendly news site, so I created Travel Today, a site where you can find fun and informative articles about traveling.

## The problem

The biggest challenge here was understanding how to use media queries. More specifically how to best structure the HTML in order for the media queries to only target certain content on the site. Using divs and naming classes in a pedagogical manner helped a lot! Aesthetic improvements I think are needed:
Same size of all images in the smaller news cards.
Menu buttons should not stay highlighted after clicking on mobile.
Full opacity on the text in the news cards.
